      <h2>Resource Description Framework (RDF) Representation</h2>
      <p>
        FHIR resources can be represented as an <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF graph <img src="http://build.fhir.org/external.png" style="vertical-align: baseline"/></a> serialized in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle format <img src="http://build.fhir.org/external.png" style="vertical-align: baseline"/></a>.
        The RDF format is defined to assist the process of bridging between operational data exchange and formal knowledge processing systems.
        While the RDF form offers a fully functional representation of FHIR resources, it has different operational characteristics from the <a href="json.html">JSON</a> and <a href="xml.html">XML</a> representations, and would be implemented for different reasons.
        Systems focused on operational exchange of data would not generally choose to use RDF.

        <h3>RDF Graph Languages</h3>
        <p>
          RDF is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph">graph data model</a> composed of a set of zero or more (unordered) assertions, each expression a relationship between one node and another.
          The two nodes are called a the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-subject">subject</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-object">object</a>, and the relationship is called the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-predicate">predicate</a>.
          Subject nodes may be <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-iri">IRI</a>s (basically URLs) or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-blank-node">anonymous nodes</a> (nodes with no label).
          Object nodes include those, plus <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-literal">literals</a> with express scalar values.
          RDF encourages the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema Datatypes (XSD)</a> to specify the format of literal values.
        </p>

        <section id="turtle">
          <h4>Turtle RDF Format</h4>
        <p>
          RDF graphs are commonly expressed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a>.
          It may be practical for implementations to support multiple RDF formats or query (e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a>) interfaces, but FHIR/RDF mandates support for Turtle.
          All FHIR/RDF documentation is expressed in Turtle.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the standard media type for Turtle is <code>text/turtle</code>, the use of Turtle for FHIR/RDF uses the specialized media type <code>application/fhir+turtle</code>.
        </p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="schema">
        <h4>RDF Graph Schema</h4>
        <p>
          FHIR uses <a href="https://shex.io/shex-semantics/">Shape Expressions (ShEx)</a> to define and validate FHIR/RDF.
          See <a href="fhir.shex">fhir.shex</a> for the complete FHIR/RDF schema.
          Each Resource page includes a link for the subset of fhir.shex needed to complately describe that Resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          The media type for ShEx is <code>text/shex</code>

        <h3>RDF/RDF Conventions</h3>
        <p>
          FHIR/RDF imposes additional conventions to simplify recognition and manipulation of FHIR/RDF graphs:
        </p>

        <section id="resources">
          <h4>Representing resources</h4>
          <p>
            Each resource is represented as a set of RDF triples represented using the Turtle syntax.
            When a resource has a persistent identity (e.g. it can be found at a particular URL - usually a FHIR RESTful server), then that URL is its identity.
            Resources with no persistent identity (e.g. bundles from search results) have the identity of the root document -   "&lt;&gt;" in Turtle syntax.
            In this example, the resource is the subject: <code class="rdf">&lt;http://hl7.org/fhir/Observation/Obs123&gt;</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some resources can contain other resources.
            Given that the relationships can appear in any order, it cannot be assumed that the first encountered element represents the resource of interest that is being represented by the set of Turtle statements.
            The focal resource - where to start when parsing - is the resource with the relationship <code>fhir:nodeRole</code> to <code>fhir:treeRoot</code>.
            If there is more than one node labeled as a 'treeRoot' in a set of Turtle statements, it cannot be determined how to parse them as a single resource.
          </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="caseSensitivity">
          <h4>Case-sensitivity</h4>
          <p>
            While RDF predicate names are case-sensitive, FHIR avoids confuseion by assuring that there are no predicates which differ only in case.
            For example, there will be no <span class="rdf">fhir:Code</span> predicate.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="nestedNodes">
          <h4>Nested anonymous nodes</h4>
          <p>
            Content within a resource is always represented with anonymous nodes - only FHIR Resources nodes can be IRIs.
            For example, <span class="rdf">&lt;…/Obs123&gt; fhir:status [ fhir:v "final" ]</span> asserts that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="rdf">&lt;…/Obs123&gt;</span> has a <span class="rdf">status</span> of some anonymous node.</li>
            <li>That anonymous node has a <span class="rdf">fhir:v</span> of <span class="rdf">"final"</span> (the literal "final").</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="propertyNames">
          <h4>Property names</h4>
          <p>
            A great deal of effort has gone into unifying FHIR property names across resources and datatypes.
            These defined properties effectively declare the FHIR/RDF namespace with a set of polymorphic, reuseable predicates.
            For example, <span class="rdf">fhir:status</span> is spelled the same way regardless of whether it appears in an Observation, Diagnosis, or any other FHIR Resource.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other formats (XML, JSON), FHIR properties with choice datatypes, like <span class="spec">value[x]</span>, are appended with the datatype, e.g. <span class="json">valueQuantity</span>.
            In RDF, this is written <span class="rdf">fhir:value_x</span> and the object asserts its type, as in the <a href="#value_x">working example</a>:
          </p>
          <pre class="rdf nohighlight">  fhir:value [ a fhir:Quantity; … ]</pre>
        </section>

        <section id="rdflist">
          <h4>Representing Repeating Elements</h4>
          <p>
            Elements that can repeat are represented with RDF lists (officially called "RDF collections").
          </p>
          <pre class="rdf nohighlight">(elt1 elt2 …)</pre>
          <p>
            which produces an RDF list structure the the elements <code>elt1</code> and <code>elt2</code>.
            In the <a href="#ex-list">working example</a>, the <code>fhir:code</code> has a <code>fhir:coding</code> with two members:
          </p>
          <pre class="rdf nohighlight">    fhir:coding (
      [ a &lt;http://loinc.org/rdf#29463-7&gt; … ]
      [ a &lt;http://loinc.org/rdf#3141-9&gt; … ]
    )</pre>
          <p class="todo">
            A script (TODO: write said script) can convert lists to <a href="http://smiy.sourceforge.net/olo/spec/orderedlistontology.html#sec-example">OLO-style lists</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="primitive">
          <h4>Representing Primitive Elements</h4>
          <p>
            Primitive elements - elements with a primitive type - are represented as regular (anonymous) nodes so that the elements extensions can be represented.
            The actual value of the primitive type is represented as an RDF Literal using the <span class="rdf">fhir:v</span> predicate.
            The object of <span class="rdf">fhir:v</span> is always an RDF literal (as distinct from the <code class="rdf">fhir:value</code> in e.g. the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Quantity">Quantity</a> datatype):
          </p>
          <pre class="rdf nohighlight">  fhir:v "[value]"^^xs:type</pre>
          <p>
            The value has two parts: a literal string that contains the value, and, if applicable, one of the following schema types:
          </p>
          <ul class="tight">
            <li>boolean</li>
            <li>integer</li>
            <li>decimal</li>
            <li>base64Binary</li>
            <li>dateTime</li>
            <li>date</li>
            <li>gYear</li>
            <li>gYearMonth</li>
            <li>time</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The choice is made based on the types as specified for the <a href="datatypes.html#primitive">primitive type</a>.
            Note that the correct schema type for a date/dateTime must be determined by inspecting the value of the date for precision.
          </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="reference">
          <p>
            The fhir:v property can never be empty.
            Either the relationship is absent, or it is present with at least one character of content.
            XHTML is represented as an escaped xs:string.
          </p>        
          <h4>Representing References</h4>
          <p>
            A <a href="references.html#Reference">Reference</a> element is represented using the same

          <p>
            This allows faithful round tripping of the resource between the Turtle format and the JSON and XML formats.
            However, it's very useful for an RDF
            processor if the RDF graph links to the target of the reference directly.
            This can be represented using the fhir:link property:
          </p>
          <pre class="rdf nohighlight"> fhir:Observation.subjectReference [
     fhir:link &lt;http://hl7.org/fhir/Patient/example&gt;
     fhir:Reference.reference [ fhir:v "Patient/example" ]
  ];</pre>
          <p>
            The correct value for the fhir:link relationship must be determined by resolving the <a href="references.html">rules for resolving references</a> for the various reference types to a literal URL that refers to the correct content in the local RDF context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fhir:link relationship can be added automatically as part of generating the resource representation, or it can be injected by a post-processor that knows how to convert the raw references into RDF-suitable references.

          <h4>Representing Inline Resources</h4>
          <p>
            Inline resources - when a resource is contained directly in another element occur in the following places:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.resource">Bundle.entry.resource</a></li>
            <li><a href="domainresource-definitions.html#DomainResource.contained">DomainResource.contained</a></li>
            <li><a href="parameters-definitions.html#Parameters.parameter.resource">Parameters.parameter.resource</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Inline resources are represented directly as anonymous nodes.
            This is an example for a contained Medication resource:
          </p>
          <pre class="rdf nohighlight">  fhir:DomainResource.contained ([
     a fhir:Medication;
     # triples for the Medication
  ])</pre>
          <p>
            Note that DomainResource.contained has a cardinality of 0..*, so an <a href="#rdflist">RDF List</a> is used to order the array.

            For reasoners using the RDF graph, it's very useful to make the implicit

            to incorporate "IRI stems" for identifier systems to the <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/">HL7 Terminology</a> (THO) website
            and associated NPM package. If the FHIR <code>Coding.system</code> value corresponds to a <a href="codesystem.html">CodeSystem</a> or
            <a href="namingsystem.html">NamingSystem</a> defined on the THO website, and if that CodeSystem or NamingSystem includes an IRI stem,
            then the concept IRI can be determined by concatenating the IRI stem with the "IRI-safe" version of the FHIR Coding.code, which can be
            generated by using the algorithm defined in
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-r2rml-20120927/#from-template">&sect;7.3 of R2RML: RDB to RDF Mapping Language (W3C Recommendation 27 September 2012)</a>.

      <section id="ontologies">
        <h3>Relationship between the RDF, FHIR, and ontologies</h3>
        <p>
          This page documents an RDF format that can be used to exchange FHIR data, on the basis that RDF is a universal information representation.
          Using RDF enables FHIR data to be used with RDF-aware applications to support inference, shared semantics across multiple standards and data formats, data integration, semantic data validation, compliance enforcement, SPARQL queries and other uses.
          Implementers using FHIR in this fashion should be aware of the relationship between the RDF format the wider use of ontologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The RDF format is based on the same abstract information model as the <a href="xml.html">XML</a> and <a href="json.html">JSON</a> formats and carries the same information content.
          Resources are losslessly round-trippable between XML, JSON and RDF formats and data expressed in the RDF format corresponds closely to the XML and JSON formats in its look and feel.
          However, there are a few additional terms that may appear in the RDF format, which are explained below:
          <code>fhir:nodeRole</code>, <code>fhir:treeRoot</code>, <code>fhir:v</code> and <code>fhir:concept</code>.
          <a href="downloads.html">ShEx</a> schemas are available that describe the RDF format.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to defining the RDF format, this specification <a href="downloads.html">provides an associated ontology</a> that provides formal definitions for the relationships that appear in the RDF format.
          Ontologies that were designed independently almost always have some impedance mismatch when attempting to use them together. Many of the ontologies in the medical and life sciences domain are designed to capture facts about the world for research, such as the fact that the mitral valve is a kind of heart valve.
          But FHIR was designed to support the day-to-day operations of healthcare providers exchanging electronic health records (EHRs), and in this context, the orientation has historically been different.
          When using FHIR/RDF with other ontologies, impedance differences are likely to show up in two main ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Records versus facts.</b>  FHIR is oriented toward recording who did what ("Dr. Jones diagnosed patient x with viral pneumonia") rather than stating absolute medical facts ("patient x has viral pneumonia").  
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Non-monotonicity.</b>  RDF was designed to be monotonic, whereas FHIR has a few design aspects that would be non-monotonic if they were interpreted directly in RDF.
            (Monotonicity means that new data cannot invalidate previous conclusions; non-monotonicity means that previous conclusions can be invalidated by new data.)
            For example, a modifier extension indicates that the surrounding element's meaning will likely be misunderstood if the modifier extension is not understood.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For both of these reasons, to maintain monotonicity in RDF, FHIR/RDF should not be directly interpreted as stating facts; transformations are required to remove or isolate non-monotonic elements and reconcile the records across time and perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Application developers should also be aware that some FHIR data attributes have a major impact on the interpretation of the enclosing data element: the meaning of the enclosing element cannot be determined in isolation.
          For example, a status of 'entered-in-error' means that the resource was created accidentally and should be ignored for most purposes.

        <h4>Turtle Template for Resources</h4>
        <p>
          Each resource page has a set of langauge templates describing the expression FHIR in that language.
          The Turtle representation for a resource is described using this convention:
        </p>
        <pre class="spec nohighlight">Turtle Template

[ a fhir:Observation; fhir:nodeRole fhir:treeRoot;
  # from Resource: id; meta; implicitRules; and language

  fhir:Obervation.status [ fhir:v "&lt;code&gt;" ]; # R!  registered | preliminary | final | amended +
  fhir:Obervation.code [ <a href="#">CodeableConcept</a> ]; # 1..1 R!  Type of observation (code / type)
  fhir:Obervation.subject [ fhir:reference [ <a href="#">Patient</a>|<a href="#">Group</a>|<a href="#">Device</a>|<a href="#">Location</a> ] ]; # 0..1 Who and/or what this is about
  fhir:Obervation.encounter [ fhir:reference [ <a href="#">Encounter</a> ] ]; # 0..1 Healthcare event during which this observation is made
  # effective[x]: 0..1 Clinically relevant time/time-period for observation. One of these 2:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To build a valid Turtle instance of a resource, replace the contents of the property values with valid content as described by the type rules and content description found in the property value for each element.
          </li>
          <!-- <li>In this example:
               <ol>
               <li><code>property1</code> has a primitive data type; the value of the property will be as described for the stated type</li>
               <li><code>property2</code> has a complex data type; the value of the property is an object that has the content as described for the stated type</li>
               <li><code>property3</code> is an object property that contains additional properties (e.g. propertyA; the allowable properties are listed (but also include extensions as appropriate)</li>
               <li><code>property4</code> is an array property that contains items which are objects themselves. The items may have any of the types already encountered in points 1-3</li>
               <li><code>propertyA</code> has a binding to a value set - the Short description is a link to the value set. In addition, the binding strength is shown </li>
               <li><code>propertyB</code> is a reference to a particular kind of resource </li>
             </ol>
        </li> -->
          <li>
            Nodes are never empty.
            If an element is present in the resource, it SHALL have properties as defined for its type, or 1 or more <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a>
          </li>
          <li>The <span style="color: brown"><b>R!</b></span> denotes that a relationship is mandatory - it must be present (or in an array, at least one item must be present).</li>

            Create or obtain a bridge ontology that relates terms in the FHIR ontology to terms in your other ontologies.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Load your FHIR/RDF instance data and your ontologies into a reasoner and/or a triplestore, and perform SPARQL queries and/or reasoning.
          </li>
