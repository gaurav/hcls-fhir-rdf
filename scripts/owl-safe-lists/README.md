# Scripts to hide RDF lists / RDF Collections in FHIR from OWL

## Background
FHIR RDF R5 uses RDF lists (a/k/a RDF Collections) to capture the order of items, when multiple items can be specified.  For example, a patient can have multiple phone numbers, and the order of those numbers may be significant: the first one may be the preferred number, for example.  To retain order, these lists use the standard rdf:first, rdf:rest and rdf:nil vocabulary.   However, OWL uses RDF lists for its own expressive purposes and prohibits the use of vocabulary in the RDF namespace for non-OWL purposes.  This means that some OWL processors may not properly process FHIR RDF R5 data that contains RDF lists for non-OWL purposes.  

## Workaround
To work around this problem and allow OWL reasoners to properly process your data, one solution is to change FHIR RDF's use of the rdf:first, rdf:rest and rdf:nil URIs to use alternate URIs, as follows:
* rdf:first --> fhir:rdfFirst (an owl:ObjectProperty), if its object is an owl:Object, i.e., not a literal
* rdf:first --> fhir:rdfFirstLiteral (an owl:DatatypeProperty), if its object is a literal
* rdf:rest --> fhir:rdfRest (an owl:ObjectProperty)
* rdf:nil --> fhir:rdfNil

The scripts below perform such conversions, and are provided as a convenience.  Other workaround strategies are possible.  Additional contributions are welcomed if you have another means of working around this problem.  

Typical usage pattern for the scripts below:
1. Apply one of the below scripts to your data file.
2. Merge the fhir.ttl ontology into your data file.
3. Open in Protege or the tool of your choice.  This will still leave individuals as anonymous blank nodes.  To alleviate this problem you could also [skolemize](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-semantics/#skolemization) those blank nodes to become IRIs.

Other lists are not touched, even if they are not OWL lists.
